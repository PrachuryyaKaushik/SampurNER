# SampurNER
 "SampurNER: Fine-grained Named Entity Recognition dataset for 22 Indian Language" is the first contribution in fine-grained named entity recognition for all 22 scheduled Indian languages. We have proposed a highly efficient Entity-anchored Machine Translation (EaMaTa) method that beats the state-of-the-art by a significant margin (~9%).
